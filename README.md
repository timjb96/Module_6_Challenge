# Module 6 Challenge
This challenge was meant to help potential clients pick a travel itinerary that matched their needs- specifically, their preferred temperature needs!

This was accomplished using Google APIs to generate a list of cities of random world series, based on generating random latitudes and longitudes. 

Then, these cities were filtered based on temperatures as input by the client/user. Once refined, we manually selected four cities near eachother that fit into the refined list. 

Once this was complete, we utilized gmaps to generate actual maps and travel itineraries for our client, by using the API to also find hotels near the chosen cities. As a result, our clients will be receiving a travel itinerary tailored to their climatic preferences!
